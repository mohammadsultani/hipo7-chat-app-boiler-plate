# hipo7-chat-app-boiler-plate
A boiler plate setup for building a real-time chat application with MEVN stack.  

Clone the repo and run npm install in root directory and in client directory.

All the required dependencies are already installed.

To run frontend => npm run serve in client directory. 
To run the server app => node index.js in root directory. 

There are some useful resources in the landing page of the app.

Remember this is meant to be a boiler plate setup to get you up and
running, not a full functional app.

The link to deployed chat app is here.
