# hipo7-chat-app-boiler-plate
A boiler plate setup for building a real-time chat application with MEVN stack.  

Clone the repo and run npm install in root directory and in client directory.

All the required dependencies are already installed.

To run frontend => npm run serve in client directory. 

To run the server app => node index.js in root directory. 

There are some useful resources in the landing page of the app.

You are suggested to use Buefy as your frontend css framework.

Remember this is meant to be a boiler plate setup to get you up and
running, not a full functional app.
